Notes on objects ordering
=========================

Objects are ordered to be imported in waves. Objects in each wave can depend only on objects in preceding waves.
(By depending we mean that the other object should exist in repo in order to assure warning-less import. Usually,
assigned/induced objects should exist. Objects that are referenced e.g. in groovy code are not required at the
import time.)

Waves are:
- 0xx: security policy and system configuration
- 100: resources (do not depend on anything)
       root orgs (do not depend on anything)
       user template (inactive until users are imported)
       grouper function library (inactive until async updates come)
- 200: metaroles and roles (contain constructions i.e. references to resources)
- 300: archetypes (induce resources, root orgs, metaroles)
- 400: specific orgs i.e. org-grouper-sysadmin (has an archetype)
- 600: specific users i.e. user-banderson (is in specific orgs)
- 9xx: bulk actions (testing all resource, recomputing grouper objects)
